# AutoZone-WITTDTJR-Dash-Board-Tracker
Every day we had to know our numbers for what it takes to do the job right sales and I got tired of manual tracking.

The failure of this project was caused my what I planned to use to display the program. I wanted to use a cheap Android Tablet. Issue is android can not run java native. I ended up having to buy a slate to run it to demo it but the powers that be thought the device was to fragile for our work environment and the cost to high if broken.

I later redid the app in App Inventor 2 and just used my phone to track my own personal stuff.
